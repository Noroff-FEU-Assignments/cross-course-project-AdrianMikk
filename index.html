    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">Security is always important. I would advise installing security plugins so you can defend your website against brute-force attacks, plugin exploits, and more. You should use Https so that malicious parties can't observe what data is being sent. As a result usernames and passwords can't be stolen in transit when users enter them into a form. You should update your site regularly, so it's less likely to get hacked. And you should invest in an automatic backup. </p>
